# MyLinux
The goal of this work is to build your own Linux in a VM with the Gentoo Distribution

The major part of this work is related to the [Gentoo Handbook (AMD64)](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64)

## Prerequisites
* Download VMware Workstation 
* Download [Gentoo distribution](https://www.gentoo.org) > Downloads > amd64 > minimal installation cd & stage3 systemd

### VMware Workstation
Launch VMware Workstation and create a new VM

* Select 'custom' > Workstation > Install later > Select 'Linux 6.x kernel 64 bit'
* Put a name to your VM
* Click on 'customize hardware' > New CD/DVD > Use ISO > Select `minimal installation cd` and check `connect at power on`
* Create the VM

Now, we have to put the VM on UEFI instead of BIOS : VM (toolbar) > Settings > Option > Advanced > UEFI

You're ready to launch the VM !
